    "## M/M/1 Queue Simulation Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "The M/M/1 queue is a classic model in queueing theory, representing a system with a single server and customers arriving and being served in a first-come, first-served manner. Both the arrival and service processes are assumed to follow an exponential distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "In this simulation, we aim to understand the behavior of an M/M/1 queue under different service rates and to estimate the expected waiting time for customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Service Rate** ($\\mu$): The rate at which the service station can service customers. This can be a scalar or a vector, indicating the service rate at each design point.\n",
    "- **Arrival Rate** ($\\lambda$): The rate at which customers arrive at the service station. This is a constant value across the simulation.\n",
    "- **Number of Replications** ($n$): The number of simulations (or replications) to run at each design point. This helps estimate the variability in the system.\n",
    "- **Run Length**: The number of customers simulated in each replication, determining the length of each queue simulation.\n",
    "- **Initialization Method**: The method used to initialize the simulation. Options include 'stationary', 'mean', and 'zero'.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Estimate Mean Waiting Time**: Compute the average waiting time of customers at each design point, averaged over all replications.\n",
    "2. **Estimate Variance in Waiting Time**: Calculate the variance in waiting times at each design point to understand the system's variability.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Equations\n",
    "\n",
    "The expected steady-state waiting time in an M/M/1 queue is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ W = \\frac{\\lambda}{\\mu(\\mu - \\lambda)} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- $W$: Expected waiting time\n",
    "- $\\lambda$: Arrival rate\n",
    "- $\\mu$: Service rate\n",
    "\n",
    "This equation is used to calculate the theoretical mean waiting time at each design point for comparison with simulated results.\n"
